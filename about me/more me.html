        Who am I?
    </h1>
    <p>
        My name is Ashley and I am a first year student attending SAIT. My main focus is in the <strong>Web Design and Development program.</strong> This is something that is completely new to me and is something that I am interested in.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Some things I am learning include:
    </h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            HTML code and what it means
        </li>
        <li>
            CSS code, not only what it means but how it enhances a webpage
        </li>
        <li>
            How GitHub works, GitHub Desktop and Visual Studio Code as well
        </li>
        <li>
            The pros and cons of website builders
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        I love being able to create new pieces! Whether that is a new website or paintings and drawings. So far I have really enjoyed the CSS portion of this course. I love being able to add colour and fonts to a webpage. Being able to customize the look of a website and make it visually pleasing is something I enjoy doing.
